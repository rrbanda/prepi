# Prologue: The Promise

You've used ChatGPT. You've seen it write poetry, debug code, and explain quantum physics. And somewhere in the back of your mind, a question lingers:

*How does it actually work?*

This handbook answers that question. Not with hand-waving or jargon, but with genuine understanding. By the end, you'll be able to explain — clearly, confidently, and correctly — how a large language model transforms your words into its response.

## Our Running Example

Throughout this book, we'll trace a single prompt through the entire system:

> **"The Eiffel Tower is located in"**

By the final chapter, you'll know exactly what happens to these six words — how they become numbers, how those numbers interact, and how "Paris" emerges as the response. Every concept we cover will touch this example.

Think of it as a thread running through the entire book. When you finish, you'll be able to trace any prompt through the same journey.

We'll start with the magic trick: what appears to happen when you talk to an AI. Then we'll peel back the curtain, layer by layer, until you understand every step of the journey from your prompt to its response.

Along the way, you'll learn:

- Why LLMs are fundamentally "just" prediction machines — and why that's profound
- How text becomes numbers that preserve meaning
- What attention really does (with analogies that stick)
- How training creates intelligence from statistics
- Why models hallucinate, and what they truly can't do

No prior machine learning knowledge required. Just curiosity.

By the final chapter, you'll understand not just the theory, but how to deploy LLMs in production using platforms like OpenShift AI.

Let's begin.
