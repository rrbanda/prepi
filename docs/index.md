# The LLM Handbook

**A Complete Guide to Understanding Large Language Models — From Concepts to Production**

---

## About This Book

This handbook takes you from zero knowledge to complete understanding of how Large Language Models work. Whether you're building AI products, deploying models to production, or simply curious about the technology behind ChatGPT, this guide will give you the mental models you need.

**No prior machine learning knowledge required. Just curiosity.**

## The Journey

Throughout this book, we trace a single prompt through the entire system:

> **"The Eiffel Tower is located in"** → **"Paris"**

By the final chapter, you'll know exactly what happens to these words — how they become numbers, how those numbers interact, and how "Paris" emerges as the response.
